tunnelsnake (a.k.a. nonsensebot)
================================

A little hipchat bot that I wrote for Neon Stingray code club. Loads in data from hipchat logs then uses it to try to construct coherent replies using markov chains. And fails, constructing complete gibberish barely related to the input. The code is full of copy-pastes, is untested and falls apart if you glare at it too hard. 

On the upside I got to play around with co and ES6 generators. What a revelation! So easy! :D
